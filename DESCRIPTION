Description: The InfiniumDiffMetMotR package provides an integrated analysis pipeline for Illumina infinium methylation array. It inculdes functions of normaluzation,  M-value computation, differentially methylation analysis, and motif overrepresentation analysis for the differentially methylated regions. It is also included motif data base such as JASPAR CORE and IMAGE.
